# Roblox Studio MCP

Connect your coding agent directly to Roblox Studio. It can edit places, run Luau
in live server and client contexts, start and stop playtests, and collect logs,
screenshots, memory reports, and profiler captures from each peer.

## What it can do

### Debug a running game

- Run Luau with `eval_server_runtime` or `eval_client_runtime`. Both tools execute in a live server or client context and use the same `require` cache as your game scripts.
- Instrument live code with `breakpoints`. It records each hit without pausing the playtest.
- Read output from edit mode, the server, or a specific client with `get_runtime_logs`, including messages logged during startup. A runtime error is one entry with `script`, `line`, and `stack`; narrow the stream with `level`, `since_ts`, and `exclude`, or collapse repeats with `dedupe`.

### Automate playtests

- Start, inspect, and stop solo or multi-client sessions with `solo_playtest` and `multiplayer_playtest`.
- Open or close Studio windows with `manage_instance`. It can launch a baseplate, a local place file, a published place, or an older place revision.

### Find performance problems

- Record server or client CPU timings with `capture_script_profiler` and `capture_micro_profiler`.
- Break down memory use with `get_memory_breakdown` or attribute scene cost with `get_scene_analysis`.

### Work in edit mode

- Run Luau in Studio's edit context with `execute_luau`.
- Use `set_properties` for instance properties and `find_and_replace_in_scripts` for script text. For project-specific bulk edits, use `execute_luau`.
- For large generated Luau, use the [verified chunk-staging workflow](docs/large-inputs.md): explicit instance routing, UTF-8 byte/hash readback, ownership-checked cleanup, and bounded recovery without blindly replaying mutations.
- Find which instances carry a CollectionService tag and which scripts use it with `search_tags`; `get_instance_properties` lists an instance's tags.
- Use `selection` to inspect or update Studio selection and frame a part or model before capturing the viewport.
- Capture the viewport with `capture_screenshot`, then send mouse or keyboard input. When Studio's own capture APIs cannot see the play viewport (a blank frame or an EditableImage error during a playtest), the server grabs the Studio window through the host OS instead and crops it to the viewport — this works with Studio behind other windows, though not minimized. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md#host-window-capture).

### Inspect Creator Store assets

- Find public assets with `search_assets`, then read the full catalog metadata with `get_asset_details`.
- Check an asset's hierarchy, media metadata, and security scan with `preview_asset` before adding it to the place.
- Add an asset with `insert_asset`. The tool removes scripts and package links, verifies the cleaned result, and then parents it in Studio.

### Look up Roblox APIs

- Fetch official engine API documentation as Markdown with `get_roblox_docs`.
- List and retrieve Roblox-authored skills with `get_roblox_skills`.

See the [complete tool list](packages/core/src/tools/definitions.ts).

## Setup

1. Add the server to your MCP client. `--auto-install-plugin` also installs the matching Studio plugin:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add robloxstudio -- npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --auto-install-plugin

# Codex CLI
codex mcp add robloxstudio -- npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --auto-install-plugin

# Gemini CLI
gemini mcp add robloxstudio npx --trust -- -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --auto-install-plugin
```

2. After the plugin is installed or updated, fully close and reopen Studio. The plugin shows **Connected** when it is ready.

Multiple open places can connect to the same server. Call `get_connected_instances`, then pass either a top-level `instances[].id` or a role-suffixed key from `multiplayerGroups[].instances` as `instance_id` with later tool calls.

Set `MCP_PLUGINS_DIR` to use a custom Plugins folder. For a manual plugin install, run `npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --install-plugin`.

<summary>Other MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "robloxstudio-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest", "--auto-install-plugin"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, wrap with `cmd /c` if `npx` doesn't resolve:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "robloxstudio-mcp": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest", "--auto-install-plugin"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Inspector edition (DataModel read-only)

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp-inspector)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp-inspector)

25 Studio-safe inspection tools: no DataModel or script edits. The selection
tool can change editor selection and camera framing; export and profiler tools
can write files only to explicit local paths. Install only one variant at a time
(the installers remove the other automatically):

```bash
claude mcp add robloxstudio-inspector -- npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp-inspector@latest --auto-install-plugin
```
