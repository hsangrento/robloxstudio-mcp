# Token-efficiency contract

Version 3.0 treats the MCP wire surface as a budgeted public API.

## Catalog budget

The regression test caps the serialized public catalog at 45,000 characters
(21,000 for the inspector edition; raised from 44,000/20,000 on 2026-09-15 when
search_tags and the get_runtime_logs filters were added),
tool descriptions at 120 characters, and argument descriptions at 64 characters.
It also requires structured output schemas for every tool except the
Markdown-returning `get_roblox_docs` tool. Change the budget only as an explicit
API decision.

## Advertisement contract

- A tool description is one sentence that explains when or why to call it.
- Every input property describes its meaning and any constraint not already
  encoded by `enum`, `required`, bounds, or another JSON Schema keyword.
- Tool annotations contain only `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`,
  `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` behavior metadata.
- Server instructions hold shared constraints and cross-tool sequences. They are
  generated from the tools exposed by each server edition, so they never name an
  unavailable tool.
- Detailed workflows and safety notes are available on demand at
  `robloxstudio://tool-guides`. Official engine references remain available through
  the `robloxdocs://` resource templates.

The server advertises shared instructions once. Clients read the detailed tool
guide only when needed, and the guide is not part of the tool catalog.

## Response contract

- Modern 2026-07-28 clients receive JSON once, in `structuredContent`.
- Legacy 2025 clients receive one JSON text projection for compatibility.
- Human-readable Markdown and image/audio content remain content blocks.
- Known bundle, plugin-session, debug, and diagnostic metadata fields are
  removed at the protocol boundary.
- `get_connected_instances` returns standalone and edit processes as compact
  role-to-Peer maps. Temporary multiplayer processes appear only in their
  group's `instances` map, keyed by role-suffixed compact Instance IDs.
- Tool errors expose a short stable code, an actionable message, and only the
  recovery data a caller needs. Full diagnostics go to stderr.

The shared boundary in `packages/core/src/mcp-runtime.ts` owns catalog projection,
annotations, input/output schemas, result normalization, and public error shaping
for both HTTP and stdio transports.
